# Brute force your way into a website login that uses POST requests to log in

<br>

Requirements
<br>
**=> Website must use POST method as login form** 

**=> This is not really brute force, but a dictionary attack. Many people use these terms synonymously.**

<br>
This tool can be used to brute force into any account on any website as long as there is no fail-to-ban-bruteforce-protection. This program uses headers to use a different ip address every login to avoid an ip ban. 

<br>

Be aware that usually websites will ignore the X-Forwarded-For header and instead use different methods to get your IP.

This is for educational purposes only. Do NOT use this tool!
