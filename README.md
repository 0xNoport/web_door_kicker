# brute_force_tool

This tool can be used to brute force into any account on any website with exceptions. This program uses headers to use a different ip address every login to avoid an ip ban. 
!!! Be aware that usually websites will ignore the X-Forwarded-For header and instead use different methods to get your IP. !!!

This is for educational purposes only. Do NOT use this tool!
